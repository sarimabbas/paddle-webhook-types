# Paddle Webhook Types

I couldn't find TypeScript definitions for Paddle's webhook payloads, so I created them myself. Open up an issue if you find something is wrong!

## Installation

```
yarn add paddle-webhook-types -D
```

## Usage

```ts
import { PaymentRefunded } from "paddle-webhook-types";
```
